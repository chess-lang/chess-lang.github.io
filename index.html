    <p><strong>ChessL</strong> is a simple serialization and configuration
    language inspired by TOML and SDLang. It's a superset of JSON that's simple
    to understand, readable, and easy to edit by hand.</p>

    <h1>Why?</h1>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> is great, but it has a very
      low signal-to-noise ratio. It&rsquo;s uncomfortable to edit by hand, and
      to read.</li>

      <li><a href="https://yaml.org/">YAML</a>, while human-friendly, is an
      unholy behemoth of a language. The specification is infamous for being
      more than ten times the size of the JSON spec, with many redundant or
      unnecessary features (including <a href=
      "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3790454/in-yaml-how-do-i-break-a-string-over-multiple-lines/21699210#21699210">
      9-63 ways of writing a multi-line string</a>).</li>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML</a> is nice for
      configuration files (which are basically a huge map of key:value pairs),
      but not as nice for heavily nested objects.</li>

      <li><a href="https://sdlang.org/">SDLang</a> is great, but very
      uncomfortable to work with (as it&rsquo;s pretty much syntactic sugar for
      XML) and doesn&rsquo;t have a stable implementation in most sensible
      languages (Ruby, PHP, but not C? Come on).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There exists no serialization format I could find that makes it easy to
    preserve definition order in associative arrays <em>and</em> to work with
    them.</p>

    <p>In most JSON implementations, for example, you have two options for an
    order-preserving associative array:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>A list of pairs (makes it terrible to look up values by their key,
        which defeats the purpose of an associative array):</p>

        <div class="highlight">
          <pre>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="s2">"order_preserving_map"</span><span class=
"p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"key1"</span><span class=
"p">,</span> <span class="s2">"value1"</span><span class="p">],</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"key2"</span><span class=
"p">,</span> <span class="s2">"value2"</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>A normal object with a separate list of keys (makes it even worse to
        edit by hand):</p>

        <div class="highlight">
          <pre>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="s2">"obj"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="s2">"key1"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class=
"s2">"value1"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="s2">"key2"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class=
"s2">"value2"</span>
<span class="p">},</span>
<span class="s2">"obj_keys"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class=
"p">[</span><span class="s2">"key1"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class=
"s2">"key2"</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Neither of the two is acceptable for data meant to be edited by
    hand.</p>

    <h1>Goals</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Simple, unambigous grammar.</p>

        <p>One way of specifying multiline strings is fine. We don&rsquo;t need
        63.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Human-readable and human-editable.</p>

        <p>YAML, while extremely easy to read, is easily one of the hardest
        config/serialization languages to edit. JSON has too low a
        signal-to-noise ratio. SDLang and TOML are excellent, but do not fit
        the other criteria.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Easy to work with in code.</p>

        <p>XML-style tree traversal is not easy to work with. JSON-style
        indexing is easy to work with. JSONPath and XPath are easy to work
        with.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Minimal.</p>

        <p>If in doubt, it&rsquo;s better to leave processing to the user than
        to the parser. We don&rsquo;t need a separate datetime type, since
        every program that needs to work with dates already has a datetime
        library that can parse strings.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Strict.</p>

        <p>The more errors a ChessL parser throws when trying to parse invalid
        ChessL, the better.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Associative arrays preserve order.</p>

        <p>This is an implementation detail, but any compliant implementation
        should preserve order in associative arrays, with an optional flag to
        disable this behavior.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Elements of associative arrays and lists can have attributes.</p>

        <p>This is a feature inspired by SDLang. While unconventional and
        somewhat weird to work with in many programming languages, I&rsquo;ve
        found that it dramatically boosts the human-readability and
        human-editability of the language.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
